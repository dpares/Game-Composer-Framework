# README #

This repository contains the full source code and documentation of the Game Composer Framework, which allows developers to create multiplayer tabletop and card-based games for Android devices. It uses [Orchestrator.js](http://www.orchestratorjs.org), an open source platform for multi-device apps.

### Features ###

The Game Composer Framework forces games to follow a certain architecture, in which a game is divided into a series of **phases** and **steps**. However, there's also some functionality that works practically out of the box:

* Player profile management (username and avatar).
* Disconnection handling.
* Spectator mode.
* Rematch handling.

### Using the Game Composer Framework ###

* [Download and install Orchestrator.js in your device](https://github.com/nikkis/OrchestratorJS).
* Check out the sample games (Texas Hold'em and Parcheesi/Ludo).
* Read the wiki to learn which classes and methods must be created in order to use the framework.
