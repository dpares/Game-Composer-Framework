          <p>
            Orchestrator.js offers web-based IDE for implementing apps in heterogenous, multi-user and multi-device environment. The Web Console can be used for implementing the apps, interactions, and device capabilities. Moreover, the IDE offers tools for testing purposes: it is easy to monitor device states, read debug messages directly from web browser's console, and also developers can manually trigger interactions for a predefined set of devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            The platform currently runs in Amazon cloud, but is freely available from GitHub, and can be easily hosted on any computer with a network connectivity. The devices are constantly connected to the Orchestrator.js. On client-side we currently support Android, and devices capable of running Python. We are also working on with iOS implementation currently.

          <p> With Orchestrator.js it is easy to implement context-aware applications for a heterogenous set of device. The platform offers publish-subsrcibe API that easy to utilize in app implementations. The devices constantly report their state to the Orchestrator.js Device Registry, which publishes updates whenever devices' contextual data changes. </p>
